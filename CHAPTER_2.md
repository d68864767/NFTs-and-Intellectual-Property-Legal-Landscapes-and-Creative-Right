# Chapter 2: Intellectual Property Basics

## Introduction to intellectual property law

Intellectual property law is a branch of law that deals with the rules for securing and enforcing legal rights to inventions, designs, and artistic works. It aims to protect the rights of creators and innovators, thereby promoting innovation and creativity.

## Types of IP: Copyright, trademark, patents

There are three main types of intellectual property: copyright, trademark, and patents.

- **Copyright** protects original works of authorship, such as books, music, film, and art.
- **Trademarks** protect brand names, logos, and other identifiers of source.
- **Patents** protect inventions and discoveries.

Each type of IP protects different aspects of a creative work or invention and has its own set of rules and procedures.

## The role of IP in the digital age

In the digital age, IP rights have become increasingly important. With the rise of the internet and digital technologies, it has become easier to create, share, and copy creative works. This has led to new challenges in protecting IP rights.

In the context of NFTs, understanding IP rights is crucial. As NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, the question of who owns the underlying IP rights can be complex and contentious. This book will delve into these issues in the following chapters.
