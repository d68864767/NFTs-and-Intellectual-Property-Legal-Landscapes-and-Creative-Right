## Frequently Asked Questions about NFTs and IP

1. **What rights do I have as an NFT owner?**
   As an NFT owner, you have the right to ownership of the unique digital asset. However, this does not necessarily grant you the copyright or other intellectual property rights associated with the asset.

2. **Can I copyright my NFT?**
   Copyright laws vary by jurisdiction, but generally, if your NFT is an original work of authorship, it may be eligible for copyright protection.

3. **What happens if someone infringes on my IP rights in the NFT marketplace?**
   If someone infringes on your IP rights, you may have legal recourse. It's recommended to consult with a legal professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.

4. **Can I sell or transfer my NFT?**
   Yes, NFTs can be bought, sold, and transferred between parties, just like any other form of property.

5. **What is a smart contract and how does it relate to NFTs?**
   A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In the context of NFTs, smart contracts can be used to automate the process of buying, selling, and transferring NFTs, as well as distributing royalties to creators.
